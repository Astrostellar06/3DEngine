### 3D Engine
![3D Engine](/3D%20Engine.png)

This engine was created as a self-imposed challenge. I wanted to see if I was able to create a light-weight 3D engine from scratch, without any knowledge about how an actual 3D engine works.

The result is this wireframe 3D Engine, able to display any 3D object in wireframe.

I created two iterations. The first uses a lot of vectorial calculus and is in the folder `3DEngine 1st Iteration`. The second iteration uses a more trigonometrical approach. I decided to create a second iteration to improve the performance, with the idea to adapt the code in Basic, and eventually putting the engine in a calculator.
